# Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
# of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
# spacing.
#offset:

# Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with

# right, increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.
